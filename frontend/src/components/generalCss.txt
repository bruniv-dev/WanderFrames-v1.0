How rem and em Work:

rem (Root em): rem is relative to the root element’s font size 
(<html> element). If your root font size is 16px, then 1rem = 16px 
regardless of the parent element's font size.

em: em is relative to the font size of the parent element.
 So, if the parent has a font size of 2rem, and the child uses 2em, 
 the child's font size will be 2 times the parent’s size.

Example Breakdown:
Root font size: 1rem = 16px (default)
Parent <div>:
Font size: 2rem = 32px (since 2rem refers to 2 times the root size, which is 16px)
Child element:
Font size: 2rem = 32px (because rem refers to the root, not the parent)
Both the parent and child will have a font size of 32px in this case.

However, if using em:
Parent <div>:
Font size: 2rem = 32px
Child element:
Font size: 2em = 64px (because 2em is 2 times the parent's 32px size)
The child’s font size would be 64px, which is larger than the parent.
